# Computing-on-WassersteinSpace

This repository contains the codes to run the experiments of the work "Approximation Theory, Computing, and Deep Learning on the Wasserstein Space" by Massimo Fornasier, Pascal Heid, and Giacomo Sodini (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19548).

For all our experiments, we need the Wasserstein distance (as well as the corresponding Kantorovich potentials) to the reference image/measure. For that purpose, first run the Python scripts "CIFAR_Data.py" and "MNIST_Data.py" for the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, respectively.
